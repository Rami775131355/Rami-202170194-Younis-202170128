House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project demonstrates a workflow for predicting house prices using linear regression. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and a user-friendly interface for making predictions.

Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a linear regression model using both scikit-learn and a custom implementation from scratch. The model is trained to predict house prices based on various input features. The project also includes functionality to allow users to input custom values for these features and get a predicted house price.

Workflow

1. Data Loading: Read and inspect the house price dataset.


2. Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, check for duplicates, and scale features.


3. Model Training:

Train a linear regression model using scikit-learn.

Implement a linear regression model from scratch.



4. Evaluation: Assess model performance using metrics such as MSE, MAE, RMSE, and RÂ² score.


5. User Prediction: A final section allows users to input feature values and predict house prices.



Dependencies

numpy

pandas

scikit-learn


Install the dependencies with:

pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn

Usage

1. Load the dataset.


2. Preprocess the data (check for missing values, duplicates, and scale the data).


3. Train the linear regression model.


4. Evaluate the model using test data.


5. Use the user-input section to predict house prices based on custom feature inputs.
